2. What is the purpose of this assessment?
The following table shows which of the module learning outcomes are being assessed in this assignment. Use this table to help you see the connection between this assessment and your learning on the module.
Module learning outcomes to be assessedThe general aim of this coursework is for students to apply descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics (supported by visualisation techniques) in order to explore data, as well as develop models, which ultimately contribute to data-driven decision-making for two different problem domains and data sets (LO1, LO2, LO4). Students are expected to document and present their findings in a 4,000 word report that is worth 100% of their grade. All data, as well as the saved R scripts that highlight data manipulation and management must be stored and subm代 写INMR95 Business Data Analytics 2024/25Matlab

In more detail, the documentation should be split into three sections:Section one requires the use of inferential statistics and dimension reduction techniques in order to extract components from a survey and use the component scores in several analyses (LO1). Students are expected to critically analyse their results, manage and manipulate the data (LO3), as well as illustrate their findings using visualisation techniques (LO2). Section two requires students to train at least two types of machine learning algorithms (or regression models) in order to support data-driven decision making (LO4). 
Section three requires students to report on the results of sections one and two in a document that presents the findings for a layman audience, with explicit recommendations based on the analyses (LO4). This section needs to be particularly rich in visualisation (LO2).

Expectations for group work 
(if applicable)
   
Self-regulation: Make sure that you…Include all your R script, so keep a log of what you’re doing so you don’t have to repeat yourself. Make sure to add comments in order to highlight what you are doing in each step. 
Three key pieces of advice based on the feedback given to the previous cohort who completed this assignment1.   Do not miss seminars and workshops2.   Ask the instructors for help if you get stuck3.   Do not be put off by the steep learning curve of R. It gets easier as you work through the workshops.
Formative assessment opportunities/activities
Online quizzes, seminars, and workshops. These are NOT marked and you can repeat them as many times as you like.
5. What resources might I use to prepare my work?
Data analytics is an extremely popular field of study. As such you will have no problems finding 
information from various sources. The lecture slides, worksheets, R workshops, videos, and audio 
information that I provide should be your starting point. From there I recommend you look at books    (e.g., the Field et al., 2012, which is the other recommended textbook), online tutorials (particularly for examples in R), journal and conference papers (the last two are particularly important in order to understand how we present results of the analysis).
